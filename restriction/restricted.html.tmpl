<h1>Restricted Commit</h1>

This change:
<a href="{GERRIT_CHANGE_URL}">{GERRIT_CHANGE_URL}</a>,
patchset {GERRIT_PATCHSET_NUMBER}, with commit message
<hr>
<pre>{COMMIT_MSG}</pre>
<hr>
was rejected for submission because <b>{REASON}</b>.
<h3>Why did this happen?</h3>
The change is for the <tt>{GERRIT_BRANCH}</tt> branch of the
<tt>{GERRIT_PROJECT}</tt> project, which is listed in the manifest
<a href="https://github.com/couchbase/manifest/blob/master/{MANIFEST}"
target="_blank"><tt>{MANIFEST}</tt></a>.
This is a <b><i>restricted manifest</i></b>
for the upcoming release "<b>{RELEASE_NAME}</b>".
<p>
<b><i>Restricted manifests</i></b> are for builds targeting a specific
upcoming release. Git branches in restricted manifests can only accept
changes that are <b><i>approved</i></b> for that release.

<h3>How can a change be approved?</h3>
It is up to Product Management to decide which changes are approved.
For a change to be approved, two things must happen:
<ul>
<li>The commit message for the change must name a specific JIRA ticket
in the subject (first line of the commit message).
<li>That JIRA ticket must be listed as a dependency for the tracking
ticket for the upcoming release.
</ul>
For the "<b>{RELEASE_NAME}</b>" release, the approval ticket is
<a href="https://jira.issues.couchbase.com/browse/{APPROVAL_TICKET}"
target="_blank">{APPROVAL_TICKET}</a>.

<h3>What can I do?</h3>
First, if you are not a member of Product Management and do not otherwise
have permission to approve a change for this release, <b><u>Do not
update the tracking ticket yourself!</u></b>
<p>
You have several choices, depending on the situation:
<ul>
<li>If this change is already approved but you forgot to add the JIRA ticket
number in the commit message subject, simply edit the commit message in
Gerrit to add the ticket information. This will automatically re-check the
change for approval.
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If this change is not already approved for the release, seek approval
from product management. If approved, you will need to ensure there is a JIRA
ticket tracking your change (and that your commit message subject names this
ticket), and then PM will add that JIRA ticket to the tracking ticket for the
release. You can then re-check your change in Gerrit (see below).
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If this change is not intended for the {RELEASE_NAME} release, but the
restricted manifest shares the git branch <tt>{GERRIT_BRANCH}</tt> with
another manifest, then you will need to create a new git branch. In most
cases, this means creating a branch specifically for {RELEASE_NAME} and then
updating the manifest <tt>{MANIFEST}</tt> to refer to this new branch.
Once that is done, you should be able to re-check your Gerrit change
(see below).

<h3>Re-checking your Gerrit change</h3>
If you have gotten approval for your change; or if you believe this rejection
was caused in error; or you have otherwise corrected the problem causing this
rejection, you can always request that your Gerrit change be re-checked for
approval. To do so, simply post a comment on the Gerrit change with the text
"<tt>check approval</tt>". Your change will be re-checked within a minute.
